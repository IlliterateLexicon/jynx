# Jynx: Reflection
Jynx is a library to make using simple and complex terminal functions easy and accessable.
it  has gone through many many iterations, from differnt languages, desigin philosphys and everything inbetween

## What was the process to makeing this project
Now originally jynx was intitled neoterm and it was a very simple library that could draw some text with differnt attributes (bold, italic, etc). It was all first coded in python3 as it was (and is) the laungauge I know the best. I hade plans to countinue developing this version of the library but after adding in some of the more basic things I decided to recode in LUA. There were a couple of reasons for this, but essentailly at this point I just liked the syntax of LUA better and wanted to learn more about it and so I began to recode it for lua. Now partially the way through doing that, I decided to do a complete recode from scract so I deleted all of the script files and made a new git repo, Finnally I decided to do things properly and code the lib in C++ there are many reasons why you might want to use c++ but for this project the driving force was laungauge compatibility. By useing c++ i can "bind" the already coded C++ functions to functions for lua, python, rust, or what ever else you'd want. Which brings us to now where after cleaning up the code, 1.0 will be realeased

## What do I like about the project?
This was my first time using C++ for a major project and When I started I had very little experience, one thing I did for this project differntly then I tend to is that instead of relieing on mostly youtube videos, articles, etc. I tryed to use the first party documentation instead. While the documentation can be complex it contains magnatuides of valueble information.

## What would I have done differnt?
I think a major issue with my projects is that I often tend to just keep all my plans in my head and dont often make goals, time limits, etc which can make the direction of my projects altergreatly over time, so in future i would try and plan out 50%-75% of the project before hand defining what I want to do and settings goals for when those goals should be completed.
